### Settling On Python!

As I was browsing through the vast variety of topics to explore, I was looking for a topic that would 
be simple for me to understand, while still being useful and interesting to a large amount of people.
At first, I was overwhelmed by the number of options there were for me to explore with some of these topics ranging from
a deeper study of ruby, or another coding language entirely. Python, being one of the only languages that stood out to me from prior knowledge,
was the only choice for me. Upon further inspection, I found that it is mostly similar to javascript in terms of its' syntax but behaves similarly
to Ruby. This combination of familarity was in my opnion the perfect mixture of learning something
fresh while applying what I know from past languages I learned to aide me in my quest for understanding!
I did make a few preparations for my journey to make sure that this was my prefered topic of choice,
one of the largest things I needed to know beforehand was...

### What is Python?

From my extensive study on the jist of Python, I found that it is a computer programming language that has a wide variety of uses.
However, one of its many strong points are in its capabilities for data science and statistics. Python is mostly a 'back-end'
programming language that attempts to manipulate data and other inputs made by the user similar to that of Ruby.

> Fun Fact: The name of the language "Python" derives from the group of Brittish comedians deemed Monty Python's Flying Circus who had their own television show,
and made several movies cherrished by many worldwide!

### Exploring Python's code

When exposing yourself to a new coding language, you wonder, I have only seen syntax from past studies,
is this new language even remotely similar? In my personal experiance, I can say without a dout that Python is extremely
similar to that of ruby or javascript as I mentioned before. The hardest part however, is the syntax, lets take a look at few examples.

##### Comparison 1: Creating a variable


Javascript:

`counter = 100;`

Python:

`counter = 100`  

In this example, the only difference is that python does not use a semi-colon to end the line of code
however, it should be noted that it does take whitespace into account.


##### Comparison 2: Creating if-else Statements


Ruby:
```
x = 2
y = 6

if 1 < 2
 puts  "Result_A"

 elsif 2 > 3
  puts "Result_B"
 
 else 
  puts "Result_C"
end
```

Python: 
```
x = 2
y = 6

if x < y:
  print("Result_A")
elif x > y:
  print("Result_B")
else:
  print("Result_C")
 ```
    
Here, you can see that python uses a colon after each condition and unlike ruby,
    Python uses `elif` for an else if statement instead of `elsif` like Ruby does.

### Lets Recollect

You have read all the way up to here so you are probably wondering, what are the key points that
you should take away from this week's blog?

To that, I can only offer a response that tells you to take your time to get into the groove of things,
when there are several types of choices to study from, explore them all with your curiousity cap on. 
The best topic for you would be to find a topic that both sticks to something you found interesting or fun in the past while challenging the brain in terms of its syntax
or its capabilities.



Once you find your topic, my advice to you would be to devote yourself to it for the duration of your study.
By spending as much time as possible on your study, you will overcome that feel of learning something new becuase, in many cases, 
you find that your topic is not as foriegn as you think.The more time you spend understanding your new topic, the more you will be able to create with it. This will also make
your study seem less of a chore but more as a blank cavas waiting for its artist to make its mark.
