# Welcome Back

Hey everyone, this week, I spent all my time into making a minimum value product in the form of a website that will display a series of graphs that I make. However, due to some difficulties getting my console to understand plotly,
I was not able to use their resources. This is where I will start to explain the simple substitutions made so that the end product will be relatively the same.

# Explaining my resources

I will try explaining all the resources that I used here and what they do:

Matlib() = this is a python library which is little to no different than plotly except it is somewhat simpler in comparison. This program also has a problem on c9 when I tried installing it but the following programs helped matlib
to work.

Anaconda = This is a bundle of programs that have a strong focus on python. These programs are also used more for data analysis such as making and editing graphs.

* Spyder = This is a program bundled with Anaconda which is essentially another console that has all the programs I need built in for the most part.

# Update on final project

I would post a graph on this blog as an example of what to expect but that would take away from the overall presentation, so I will say to check back next week to get the link to view the full website.
For the record, I currently have the website made an 2 types of graphs made, i'm hoping to have at least 2 more by the end of next week.



# Takeaway

Do not get attached to your console because sometimes it may be limited in comparison to what others can do. There are many different consoles out there you can find or download for free that may satisfy your code without causing
any rukus.  It may be tough to get used to a new one but in the long term, you will get used to the new console.
