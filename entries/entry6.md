# Whats Going on this week?

Hey guys and Gals, this week was pretty long and complicated due to my Ap exams but I figured I would
spend this week to learn about more complex python concepts before I start working with them. In this blog, I am 
going to list many of the concepts that python has that are more advanced in execution but allows Python to do more in return for the 
programmer and describe how they may be useful to me for my final weeks of study.


# What else can Python do?

Ipython- This is essentially python 2.0 in my understanding as it still uses the same coding style but offers many more commands then
standard Python. If I had to describe this concept any other way, I would say it is basically python's version of ruby on rails. I am not sure
if I am going to pursue this but it is still something that I should think about if my original plans fail. 


Plotly- This is a special library for python that I can import into my console which will allow me to create visual graphs of data sets that I have. 
What is interesting about this library is that majority of the language is foreign to me despite being an advanced library of python.
This is something that i'm currently looking into which will most likely be my focus of next week unless I find something else that is still 
similar to python. 

# My goals for the next few weeks

This blog is not very content based this week and is more of a setup for the weeks to come. For the next few weeks, I will attempt to 
learn about making graphs in plotly by taking a week to learn the syntax, and spend the remaining time to tinker and create a graph that will
demonstrate a clear understanding of the language. 

If my plans for plotly are not the best project to work on, I will attempt to find something similar or make use of something such as Ipython should it
come to that point. 


# Takeaways

If you could not tell already, it is not that easy to find many unique things that python can do that is not the same as that of Ruby 
but, I had a idea. When I google what python does better than Ruby, I get the exact inverse. However, if I broaden my search to what python was
intended for, that is where I found my response. I found that python is good for trends and graphs in studies of data analysis where majority of the focus 
goes to visualizing data in various forms.
