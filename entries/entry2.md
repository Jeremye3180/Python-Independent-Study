## Python Close Reading

Hello everybody, week 2 of my study of python is complete.
This week I dove deep into python's syntax using a website called codeacademy.com which is useful because it slowly teaches
you about different types of code. The downside to this which I will explain more in my takeaway column is that this website does not really show you how the code works together in depth at least for the first 15% of the lessons.


## A small experiment with Python Syntax

After playing with small lines of code on codeacademy, I decided to open up a blank
workspace so I can play around with my own code.
The code below is my very first success at making a program with python.
Allow me to explain what each line of code does:

Full code:
```
def math(n):
  print(n**2)

math(10)
```
To start making a method in python, you write ```def``` and then a variable name and parenthesis directly after it.
It is important to recall that unlike ruby, you need a colon at the end of the header 
in order for the method to run.

Inside the method is infact, the body as it is also called in ruby which in this case, it tells python 
to take the number the user types in, and then square it(represented by ```**2```).

The final line of code tells python to run the method where the number that the user wants squared
is 10. 

Notice how there are no indication of the end of the method in python unlike ruby where every method closes with ```end ```.

## Takeaways

Last week, I gave some tips for all of you aspiring software engineers,
but I never spoke about some of my own takeaways from my reasearch.

I made it very clear last week and I will repeat it again, there is a reason why line 2 is indented in my code above,
python hates whitespace. If that line was not indented, it will not work. For me I guess its a good
thing for me because it will prevent the need to beautify my code as it will teach me the habbits of
organizing my code but this can become annoying to others.

One of the many things I learned from exploring python is
to make sure that you understand not just basic concepts like strings 
or loops, but to understand how to make all those smaller components work together
in methods and classes. I spent a lot of time last week on how the syntax looks
but I neglected to see how each line of code works with eachother which leads me to my second takeaway.

Do not judge the language you are studying by just its' syntax alone. 
I remember looking through the topics, and looking at python and its' code.
I thought "hmmm...python has majority of the things ruby has
with some small differences, studying python will be a piece of cake!"

No don't get me wrong, I still think python is an easy language to learn and I am
still commited to understanding all that it has to offer. My point is, do not pick a topic
because it seems simple at first glance.
